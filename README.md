# Python
This is my second repository in this i will upload a project made in python with mysql connectivity and tkinter.

Check out [my project documentation](https://github.com/bhookhakela/Office-Management-System/blob/main/Project_Description.pdf).

This software can:
- Allot work to employees lower in the corporate heirarchy which is stored in the MySQL table.
- Track the log in time and the log out time to determine if the subject has worked late or left early.
- Subjects can also register new employees lower than them in the corporate heirarchy.
